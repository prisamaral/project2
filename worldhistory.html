<div class="p6">This project is helping us get a better idea of the causes of the Enlightenment Rvplution which are:</div>
<ol>
  <div class="p6"><li>Economic</li></div>
<div class="p6"><li>Social</li></div>
<div class="p6"><li>Political</li></div>
<div class="p6"><li>Religion</li></div>
</ol>
  <div class="p6">Using those causes I am able to explain how these causes were able to start a revolution. We are asked to use our own knowledge on the history and geography. In this DBQ we also define what a revolution is in our own words.</div>
  <div class="p5"><center>What did I learn?</center></div>
  <div class="p6">I learned about 3 revolutions: Haitian, Latin American, and French. This helped me gain knowledge about how these revolutions started and how people fought for their rights against the governement. I was able to define what a revolution is in my own words.</div>
  <div class="p5"><center>How will this apply to my future?</center></div>
  <div class="p6">This will apply to my future because I will be able to know about what people in the past did to right for their rights and when it is time to fight for mine I won't do the same mistakes they did.</div>
