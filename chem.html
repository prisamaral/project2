           <div class="p2">Project Brief:In our current unit for Chemistry we are researching and explaining the scientific theory of where matter and energy came from. These are driving questions we have to ask ourselves when doing this project:
            <ul>
              <li><div class="p2">Where does everything we see, everything we use, and everything we are made of come from and what is it made of?</div></li>
              <li> <div class="p2">Do we observe the universe or is the universe a part of us?</div></li>
            </ul>
             <div class="p2">Knowing this we were asked to create a storyboard that will clearly tell the story of the Big Bang Theory and what our culture believes how the universe came to be. At the end of our story we would include questions we still have even after all the research we know about the scientific version and cultural one.</div>

            <th><div class="p2">What I learned? I learned that there are many beliefs to how we came to be. While researching I didn't know that our planet is actually very small because the pictures on the internet show it really big but they aren't true to scale. The Big Bang Theory went through many phases to become our planet. I can apply to this to the future because I will have knowledge of the many theories of how our universe came to me.</div></th>
