      <div class="p4"><ul>
        <li><div class="p4">This project asked us to do many things with students in our class. We were assigned partners to interview them and get to know more about their personal life. During that process we also took pictures of each other along with the interview to create a description of who we are at Da Vinci Communications or just in general. We had to go through a process of taking pictures because we wanted our pictures of our partner to tell their story.</div></li>
        <div class="b">What I learned?</div>
        <li>Something I learned while doing this project is that pictures can tell stories whether it can be a simple picture person the meaning on their face can make you feel something. In class we learned about the different properties of taking pictures such as angles, the background patters, and etc.</li>
                <div class="b">How will this apply to my future?</div>
        <li>This will apply to my future because in the future it will be consisted of technology. Social media is really big part of today's society and I'm sure it will start to increase over time. To me this project is something everyone does on social media to impact people on the media as well. I can use this in my future to send many messages that the media doesn't know about right now.</li>
